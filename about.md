>####  **Machine learning classification tool: predict puberty status denoted by breast development (Tanner B2+)**

The machine learning model featured in this prediction tool was trained using data from the Norwegian population 
sample Bergen Growth Study 2 cohort (vekststudien.no) as previously described [1].


The 'randomForest' machine learning algorithm featured here allows for **prediction of puberty onset from the female endocrine profile.**

*Machine learning model ROC performance -- 25% test data partition [n=146]: AUC=99.3%; PPV=94.2%; NPV=98.7%; ACCURACY=96.6%*
